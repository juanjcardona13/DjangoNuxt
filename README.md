# DjangoNuxt
Integration of Django + Webpack + Nuxt

I am working on a project that integrates Nuxt and Django together without losing the benefits of both as Mike Hoolehan (https://medium.com/@ilikerobots) at https://medium.com/js-dojo/vue-django-best-of-both-frontends-701307871478 and Rodrigo Smaniotto (https://medium.com/@rodrigosmaniotto) at https://medium.com/@rodrigosmaniotto/integrating-django-and-vuejs-with-vue-cli-3-and-webpack-loader-145c3b98501a did to integrate Vue and Django.


That's why I've been reading for several weeks understanding a little more webpack and how to configure it in Nuxt, and used the configurations for hotMiddleware and devMiddleware, all this work has taken me here but I still can not get both integrated in a clean way, because Django takes me the styles and designs of Nuxt and nuxt is lost in the urls of django. 

I am very grateful if anyone can assist me in this process.
